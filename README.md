# BilingualRhoticsExperiment
This program instructs native English-speaker Spanish language learners on how to match their pronunciation of rhotics (r-sounds) to the pronunciation of native Spanish speakers. The program analyzes the speaker's speech to provide dynamic feedback about their pronunciation.

# Running the compiled program
The full program for Windows can be downloaded from [this link.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vJIhHl65yUgLbF69JwqVShwsyhNtT35v/view?usp=sharing)

A Mac version [is available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lPuCPRlux92yzCIP6FHUQsWLVCbuu4VO/view?usp=sharing), but needs further testing to ensure it works.

To run the program, simply download the file from one of the above links, unzip, and run BeginStudy.exe.

# Downloading the code
To run the program in Python, you will need to download the [Vosk vosk-model-small-es-0.42 model](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) and place it unzipped in the same directory as BeginStudy.exe.

# Notes
This program is a work in progress. It will in all likelihood provide pronunciation feedback that is irrelevant to your recorded speech. I consider this to be more of a proof-of-concept than a useful tool for Spanish learners. A more mature version of this program would employ a neural network to classify the rhotics from the recorded speech and provide pronunciaition feedback based on this.
